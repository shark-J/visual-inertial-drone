# visual-inertial-drone
stereo inertial system for drones under GPS-denied area
this is a course for building an autonomous vision guided drone with intel realsense T265 camera with raspberry pi 3B and pixhawk flight controller.
The Intel RealSense Tracking Camera T265 is a type of smart camera that uses proprietary V-SLAM (Visual-Inertial Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) technology to combine data from cameras and Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) to track the cameraâ€™s position around unknown spaces where GPS might not be available. The software uses all of these data to construct and continually update maps of the environment and the location of a device with high accuracy.
the whole process is divided into 4 steps:
(1) hardware preparesion
(2)
